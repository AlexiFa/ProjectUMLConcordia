###	Problem 1	###

Description :
We choose an RATP TVM. It sells tockets for metro, bus, , tramway, train. The tickets are available in Paris depends on the zone chosen.

Assumptions :
- several zones availables (5)
- posibility to chose an "all zone" tickets
- price is the same for types of ticket (metro, tram ...)
- posibility to chose an "all transport" ticket (maybe more expensive)
- recharge card (card is for all zones) (we can do diffrent cards maybe)
- tickets is usable until the user leave the metro (or 2h once used)
- it accepts credit card and money
- the price is diffrent depends on the destination (users need to validate to leave the stations so if he goes too far according to his ticket, 
he will not be able to pass the doors)
- user can chose the language of the TVM (French, English and maybe others)
- audio description
- stations with access to people with motricity issues are specified
